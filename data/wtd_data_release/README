Terms of the Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):

1) Users of the UCSD Wireless Topology Discovery Trace will not
   distribute the trace beyond those authorized to use the trace.

2) Trace users will identify the names, affiliations, and email
   addresses of all persons (including graduate students and interns)
   using the trace data in the form above.  Traces users will identify
   future users of the trace to wtd-trace@ramp.ucsd.edu.

3) The identifiers in this trace are all anonymized to preserve the
   privacy of end users (hosts) and networks monitored in the
   collection of the trace data.  In so far as possible, trace users
   will respect the privacy of end users (hosts) and networks
   monitored in the creation of these traces.  Trace users will make
   no attempts to reverse engineer, decrypt, or otherwise identify the
   original users or devices referenced in the trace.  TRACE USERS
   WILL MAKE NO ATTEMPTS TO CONNECT TO, PROBE, OR IN ANY OTHER WAY
   INITIATE CONTACT WITH A MACHINE, MACHINE ADMINISTRATOR, OR USER
   IDENTIFIED VIA THE TRACE DATA.

4) At the end of the research, trace users will report a summary of
   the research and any findings/conclusions to
   wtd-trace@ramp.ucsd.edu (e.g., links to papers using the trace data
   are sufficient).  If any research is described on the World Wide
   Web, trace users will provide a URL to the research.  This
   information is used primarily in reports to our funding agencies.

5) In so far as possible, trace users will publish and/or make
   available their findings and conclusions.  To facilitate others to
   reproduce and/or extend published research findings, (1) use "UCSD
   Wireless Topology Discovery Trace" as a reference name for the
   trace, (2) cite the trace download location as
   "http://ramp.ucsd.edu/wtd/", and (3) include the following

The data is provided in two gzipped CSV (comma separated value) files:

	* ap_locations.csv.gz
	* wtd.csv.gz


### ap_locations.csv

The ap_locations.csv.gz file contains infomation about the locations of access
points which were known to us at the beginning of the trace period.  As
indicated at the top of the file, the fields are:

	AP_ID:			Unique identifier assigned to the access point
	X_COORDINATE:	x-coordinate (in ft) of access point w.r.t. campus 
					coordinate system.
	Y_COORDINATE:	y-coordinate (in ft) of access point w.r.t. campus 
					coordinate system.
	Z_COORDINATE:	z-coordinate (in ft) of access point w.r.t. campus 
					coordinate system.

Note that locations were not known for all access points detected during the
trace.  As expected, new access points were continuously being added to the
campus network.  In addition, many students may have used their own access
points or detected/associated with off campus access points.

Conversely, there were a few known access points which students did not
associate with during the trace.  Nonetheless, all detected and known APs have
been included in our data.

### wtd.csv

The wtd.csv.gz file contains data collected by the WTD software running on the
student's devices.  The data was collected during an 11 week trace period from
9/22/2002 to 12/8/2002.  

While a student's device was powered on, WTD sampled and recorded the following
information every 20 seconds for all APs that it could sense across all
frequencies--not just the AP the wireless card was associated with at the time:

	USER_ID:	Unique identifier assigned to the user
	SAMPLE_TIME:	The time the sample was taken by the WTD software
	AP_ID:		Unique identifier assigned to the detected AP
	SIG_STRENGTH:	Strength of AP signals received by device
	AC_POWER:	Whether the device used AC power (1) or battery (0)
	ASSOCIATED:	Whether the device was associated with this AP (1) or not (0)
	
Since WTD recorded the above information for all APs sensed during a sample, if
a user device saw 3 APs in one sample, there were 3 entries recorded for that
sample (which differ only in the AP detected, signal strength, and associated
flag).

Clock skew was corrected for at the server using the formula:

  SAMPLE_TIME = DEVICE_SAMPLE_TIME + (SERVER_UPLOAD_TIME - DEVICE_UPLOAD_TIME) 

The signal strength was as reported by the Symbol Wireless Networker 802.11b
Compact Flash cards used by the student's devices.

Wireless PDA Users" located at http://ramp.ucsd.edu/wtd/wtd.pdf.
